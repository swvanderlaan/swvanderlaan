âœ¨ I am a **biologist** turned **geneticist** and **bioinformatician** interested in **medical problems** with a passion for âœ¨ OpenScience âœ¨. 

ðŸ”­ My research interest is focused on the genetic causes of atherosclerosis underlying cardiovascular diseases. With my work I ultimately aim to move from genetic loci identified in large-scale genome-wide association studies to novel therapeutic targets and (surrogate) biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases through extensive _in silico_, and _in vitro_ modelling.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always happy to collaborate on any subject mixing cardiovascular diseases with genetics.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about James Bond.
